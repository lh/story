Once upon a time there were several nerds who decided to get together to model problems in health, social, and other vaguely governmental areas. They called themselves the HSMA - which stands for "Help, Someone Made Aardvarks".

The adventurers lived in a strane land. It was a land of magic and wonder. A land of dragons and elves and orcs and trolls. A land where the sun rose in the north and set in the west. It was a confused and dangerous place, and many who entered it did not return. Those who did were often changed by their experiences, and sometimes changed in ways that made them lose touch with the world around them. Most importantly, it was a land where the CAT reigned supreme. In fact, the CAT was so powerful that even the mighty PUN bowed before it.
